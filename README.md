# Bosskeeper - Keep the boss alive!

## Story

You start the game as a main character of any old video game and meet the slime boss - pretty much the first thing you encounter anywhere. But the boss is weak and easily defeated and therefore nobody even took the time to kill it properly. In this moment you decide that your days as a hero are over and that you would love nothing more than to help this boss to stay alive as long as possible.

In this game you have cards to help the angry slime boss to survive. Each time a marvelous hero comes by, you get the chance to place traps, walls, fields of slime and valuable barrels the hero just can't resist to look into. But watch out: if the slime boss dies, you are defeated too.

Have fun playing ~
